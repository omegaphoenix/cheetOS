			   USER PROGRAMS
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.

  Justin Leong: Approximately 31:22:50 (hh/mm/ss)
  John Li: Approximately 8 hours. Was busy planning and executing several events this week.
  Christina Lin: Approximately 26-27 hours.

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.

  Justin Leong: Implement/debug system calls and process_wait.
  John Li: Debugging.
  Christina Lin: User memory access. Argument passing.

                           ARGUMENT PASSING
                           ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

static int max_args;

This is set as the greatest argc seen and is used to initialize argv[] without
having to pass argc as an argument.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

Arguments are parsed in start_process() using strtok_r(). The arguments are
stored in an array, char *argv[], and the total number of arguments is stored
in argc. After the stack is set up, argv and argc are passed to setup_args along
with the stack pointer. We then iterate through argv two times: the first time,
we place the arguments on the stack and store pointers to their address in
an array, ptr. The second time, we push the addresses onto the stack.

To avoid overflowing the stack page, we check the size of the
arguments. We could allocate a new page if the arguments overflow but we have
not implemented that.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

It is the reentrant version which means that it can be safely called again
before the previous call is completed which makes it thread safe.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

One advantage of keeping the executable name separate is easier loading and
naming of threads. Loading requires the executable name as an argument, and
the new thread is named after the executable. Currently, we need to make a copy
of the command line arguments and tokenize the line for each of these
operations. With separated executable and arguments, we could avoid all of the
extra copies. It is easier to set up pipe and redirect as well from the shell.

Another advantage is security since the shell can handle bad commands and we
can have two levels of validation.

In our thread struct, we included these attributes and their following descriptions:

  /**@}*/


>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

File descriptors are only unique within a single process. The thread contains
an array of pointers to open files and finds an empty (null) index to place
an open file in. When an open file is closed, then it's spot in the array
is set to NULL.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

We use valid_read_addr to check the pointer to the buffer and the buffer. If
we are reading/writing from/to a file, we get the file form the thread and
make the filesys call. If we are reading/writing from/to the terminal, we
read one byte at a time and we output 300 bytes at a time.

sys_wait() calls process_wait which waits for a child to signal that it is
ready to die by setting it's status or up'ing it's wait semaphore and then
the child process's page is freed. So this finished the process termination
in certain cases.  See B8 for more detail.

To avoid obscuring code, we we check errors with the functions valid_read_addr()
and valid_write_addr(). This minimizes the amount of if-else statements within
functions.

When an error is detected, we free allocated resources by calling sys_exit()
which calls thread_exit() which iterates through all of its open files and
locks and frees them. The executable is also freed here.

Example: If an argument is not a valid read address, we call sys_exit(-1)
which sets the exit status to -1 and then calls thread_exit(). thread_exit()
frees all open files, acquired locks, the executable, and tells the lock
that it is waiting on that it is no longer waiting.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

We add a semaphore which is blocked initially and so sys_exec() waits
on this sempahore before returning. The semaphore is up'ed when the
executable has completed loading and the thread has a boolean "loaded"
which is true if successful. Once sys_exec() resumes, it can check
the boolean and then return.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you

>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

When P calls wait(C) before C exits, the kid's status is not set to
THREAD_DYING yet and so P waits on a semaphore that is initialized to 0
and which is incremented when the kid is ready to die. Then it gets the
exit status and frees the kid.

After C exits, if it hasn't been freed by a previous wait call,
P just gets the exit status and frees the kid. If it has been freed, P
returns -1;

When P terminates wihtout waiting, it tells each one of it's kids that they
don't have a parent anymore by setting their struct thread *parent to NULL.
If this is before C exits, then when C exits, thread_schedule_tail() will
free the kid. If this is after C exits, then the kid is freed right away
before the parent dies.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

When accessing user memory, we first check that the address is below PHYS_BASE
and then attempt to read/write. In case of a page fault, instead of exiting,
we set eax to -1. This byte is read and the address is deemed invalid.

This method is fast because it takes advantage of the processor's MMU. Also, it
distinguishes between read and write for clarity.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

The advantage is that it is quick and easy to access open_files from the array
since fd maps directly to an index (by subtracting 2 for stdin and stout).
The disadvantage is that this always takes the same number of bytes to store
the array which can lead to corruption of the thread memory with too many
processes. Using a linked list would reduce the space requirement on the
thread struct but would increase the access time and complexity of getting the
file associated with a file descriptor.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We didn't change it.

			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

The suggested order of implementation was misleading for this assignment. In
section 5.2, it says "After the above are implemented, user processes should
work minimally. At the very least, they can write to the console and exit
correctly." But this is false -- the suggested temporary fixes for argument
passing and process_wait() were not adequate for tests to pass.

Instead, the order of implementation, based on our experience, should be:
- user memory access
- complete argument passing
- syscall_handler
- syscall_write
- syscall_exit
- complete process_wait
- the rest of the syscalls
